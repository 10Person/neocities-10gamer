                    Chapter 3.
                </h3>
                <p>
                Here we begin with our glorious protagonist,<br>
                Notable for nothing, neither pragmatist,<br>
                Nor idealist, but a tabula rasa.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                They live in naught but a house, a . . . chamber, a bathroom, a kitchen-room. What all of the middle class have.<br> 
                Their nation was in trouble.<br> 
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;At once they heard a commotion outside.<br> 
                Gunshots.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp;. . .<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;. . . .<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;They woke up upon the floor.<br>
                They were singing outside.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;They were talking outside.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;"Long live the Ideology to save our Nation! Our FOLK! Our FREEDOM!"<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;"Vive ca!"<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;. . .<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Their door opened.<br>
                A kick,<br>
                &emsp; &emsp;A shout,<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;A crack—<br>
                And so they ended gone. A thunder of the light and shout. Another crack. They came wondering where our protagonist was, but he was gone. Where? That is their question.<br>
